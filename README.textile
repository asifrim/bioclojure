h1. BioClojure

As big data becomes common place in genomics and genetics, a functional language such as clojure might just provide part of a solution for parallelizing data analysis.

h2. Initial focus

Initial focus is next-generation sequencing and sequence variation. This includes:

* handling FASTQ and bam files (todo; maybe interfacing with Picard)
* handling VCF files

h2. Dependencies

* incanter
* clojure-contrib

h2. Disclaimers

* As I'm completely new to clojure, this library will be slow to grow, at least initially.
* As I don't use clojure (much) in real-life work (yet), this library will be slow to grow, at least initially.
* As I have to focus on real work, focus will be what I need: NGS.
